# 4-bit Arithmatic Unit Design

This was an assignment given to someone by a course teacher of [North South University](http://www.northsouth.edu/). The assignee couldn't complete her project and she asked me to complete this one for her in exchange of money. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: I know it is not ethical to do something like this for money. But the project seemed too easy to me and it didn't actually consume much time at all. :smiley: I also needed some money to buy a  skullcandy ink'd wireless for myself. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: So I had completed her project and bought that beauty. :blue_heart:

Now I am giving the sources here just because if you use it at all you can also donate me to buy something new. :santa:

The project is explained throughly in this [report](https://github.com/saumiko/4bitALUlogisim/blob/master/Report/Report.pdf). You will find the final circuit in [this](https://github.com/saumiko/NSU_DLD_Project/blob/master/ALU.circ) file. You will need [Logisim](https://sourceforge.net/projects/circuit/) to see the whole thing.
